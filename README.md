# lambda_and_streams
Simple initilization classes and some tasks with answers which are accompanying a presentation for vocational school. This repo is the example solution which was used after my classmates got a chance to try to solve the tasks.

Strings and comments are in german, the comments mostly contain the task or an explanation abolut the answer.

Tasks ("Aufgaben") 1-3 are using lists of randomly generated numbers with the goal of demonstrating how to use .forEach(), .reduce(), .map() and .peek() from the Stream interface, as well as lambda expression.
Task 4 is using .csv files containing data from this years "Bundesliga" (football league), the goal of this task was to demonstrate how to use lambda expression and multiple functions of the Stream interface chained together to get specified output from the data (scored goals, seperated by home/away team, all game results of a team).
